## Introduction

This project represents my initial exploration into web development with Bootstrap. It's a simple website designed to demonstrate my understanding of responsive design and front-end development using Bootstrap.

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is designed to look great on various devices and screen sizes.
- Bootstrap components: I have used Bootstrap's pre-built components to enhance the site's user interface.
- Custom styling: While Bootstrap provides a solid foundation, I've also added some custom CSS to personalize the website.
